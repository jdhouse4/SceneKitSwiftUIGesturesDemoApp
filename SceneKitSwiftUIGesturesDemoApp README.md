# SceneKitSwiftUIGesturesDemoApp


SwiftUISceneKitGesturesDemoApp is to test out various SwiftUI DragGesture techniques to affect rotation of the default camera in a scene graph. It is not meant for production. 

Apple's declarative UI framework SwiftUI, introduced in 2018, represents a leap in an app developers' ability to create fully functional, beautiful apps. The introduction of SceneView, the implementation of SCNView found in UIKit, into SwiftUI extended SwiftUI into the realm of 3D applications. 

Yet, there were growing pains among developers like me in using SceneView. A previous background in SceneKit in UIKit proved not to necessarily be an advantage. So, I created this demo app to try to work-out how to get this to work.

If you have come across this repository and like the code, please let me know. If you would like to use the code, I am both humbled and worried, asking you to please make sure that you want to do so. I'm not a Turing awardee, so please use any code carefully.

There is a bit of content within this repository that is not to be used, specifically the contents within art.scnassets, including but not limited to Orion_CSM.scn. The contents within this repository's scnassets are the sole property of, and owned exclusively by, James Hillhouse and may not be used in an app for distribution without prior permission by James Hillhouse. 

I spent what must have been well north of 2,000 hours building, revising, researching, and completely rebuilding the Orion spacecraft model and its texture maps. The length of time may be more due to my own inherent limitations, but that time was otherwise precious to me and I would appreciate it if anyone making it to this repository would respect my request not to appropriate this material.
